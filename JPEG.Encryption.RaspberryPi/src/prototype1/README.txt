| This folder contains the files required for the first prototype for         |
| JPEG-Encryption. It is based on the sample file within the OpenCV-project   |
| (facedetect.py).                                                            |
|                                                                             |
| Required:                                                                   |
| 1) connected web cam (USB)                                                  |
| 2) WebServer (e.g. apache up and running)                                   |
| 3) A folder that is accessible through HTTP (e.g. /var/www/)                |
| 4) OpenCV 2.3.1 in the folder ../../OpenCV-2.3.1/                           |
| 5) JPEG.Encryption files in                                                 |
|               ../JPEG.Encryption/JPEG.Encryption.C/JPEG.Encryption.Core     |
|                                                                             |
| Start prototype:                                                            |
| 1) make sure run.sh is executable (chmod +x ./run.sh)                       |
| 2) start prototype with "./run.sh"                                          |
|                                                                             |
| Remarks:                                                                    |
| This is the very first prototype of the project. Although the performance   |
| is quite bad, it gave us the first ideas how such a solution can be         |
| implemented.                                                                | 
|                                                                             |
